# Launching the whole workflow

After cloning the pipeline, please, work from within it to preserve the architecture  

We recommend that you clone the pipeline ***for each of your new project*** and work within it.   

Keep all project separated otherwise it will be difficult to recover your results.   


All options and input must be set in the config file: `config/config`

an example is provided [here](https://github.com/QuentinRougemont/genome_annotation/blob/main/example_data/example.config)

## Input data

Your **input data** may be

\- one genome containing both sex/mating type chromosomes

\- or two haplotypes containing each one of the sex/mating type chromosomes.

\+ RNAseq data for each genome (optional) + a custom TE database (compulsory for annotation) 


==** Warning names** ==
we recommend to use short name for each of your genome assemblies name and avoid any special characters appart from underscore.

**For instance:**

species-1.fasta will not be valid in GeneSpace. => Use **Species1.fasta** instead.

For the chromosome/contig/scaffold ids we recommand a standard naming including the Species name within it without any thing else than alhpanumeric character.  


## Example input data


several files are **Compulsory** 

see [example data folder](https://github.com/QuentinRougemont/genome_annotation/blob/main/example_data) 


	* genome1: `example_data/genome1.fa.gz`

==Give examples of files for RNAseqlist and bamlist HERE==

### Options

**(*a*) - Align RNA & Annotate:**  
Will perform alignment of provided RNA-seq data and use it as additional information for genome annotation.

**(*b*) - Annotate, use BAM of RNA**  
Will use provided BAM of already aligned RNA-seq data and use it as additional information for genome annotation.

**(*c*) - Annotate, no RNA**  
Will perform genome annotation without using RNA information.

**(*d*) - Skip**  
If you have already annotated your genome, will use provided gtf for the following steps, effectively skipping genome annotation.

## Operations of step I

With option *d*, all the following operations are skipped.

### 1\. Alignment of RNA-seq data (only with option *a*)

Corresponding script: `00_scripts/launch_rnaseq.sh`

- Reads trimming using **trimmomatic**

The script will detect whether the data is Single-End or Paired-End and launch trimmomatic, then count the number of retained reads.

- Creation of database for **gsnap** using **gmap**
- Alignment using **gsnap**

Corresponding scripts: `00_scripts/03_gsnap_PE.sh` for PE ; `00_scripts/03_gsnap_SE.sh` for SE

- Mapping quality assessment

Sequencing depth and MAPQ along the genome will be computed and plotted. The resulting plots can be found in ==XXX/Depth/== and ==XXX/mapq/== .

==Insert example plot here==

### 2\. TE discovery and masking

Corresponding script: `00_scripts/launch_step05_to_08.sh`

- *De novo* repeat identification using **repeatmodeler** on the input genome(s) to be annotated
- Genome masking using **repeatmasker** with known TE libraries

### 3\. Genome annotation, quality assessment and filtering

Corresponding script: ./00_scripts/06_braker.sh

- Five successive rounds of gene prediction based on protein database, using **braker**
    
- One round of gene prediction using RNA-seq data, using **braker** (only with options *a* and *b*)
    
- Quality assessment and reports production for each round of gene prediction
    

Two tools can be used at this stage for quality assessment:  
\- **Busco** (corresponding script: `00_scripts/07_busco_after_braker.sh`)  
\- **Braker** report on the raw hintsfile  
This report includes number of genes, number of introns per gene, gene support, number of complete genes and various histograms useful for error checking.

- Combination of protein-based and RNA-seq-based gene models using **TSEBRA** (only with options *a* and *b*)

Please read the [TSEBRA manual](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/TSEBRA) before running the script.  
The best round of protein-based gene prediction and the RNA-seq-based gene prediction are given as input in TSEBRA.  
Warning: TSEBRA parameters *intron_support* and *stasto_support* are set to 0 in this workflow (default in TSEBRA: 1 and 2 respectively). This means that only overlapping genes between the two gene models will be filtered. You can change this parameter and others to adjust to your desired level of stringency in the TSEBRA config file: `config/default.cfg`

- Final genome annotation reshaping

**For options *a* and *b*:** The final genome annotation  is the output from TSEBRA.  
**For option *c*:** The final genome annotation is the best protein-based braker round, as evaluated with busco.

Corresponding script: `00_scripts/08_braker_reshaping.sh`  
The genes will be renamed to insert the scaffold name for clarity in downstream analyses.  
Because the next steps in the workflow involve single copy ortholog identification, only the longest transcript is kept for each gene.

- Final genome annotation quality assessment

Two more in-depth tools can be used at this stage for quality assessment: (==\+ busco on final genome pred ?==)  
\- **Blast** against **Uniprot**  
If you wish to skip this, comment l.295 of the script `00_scripts/08_braker_reshaping.sh`  
\- **InterProScan** (if option interpro is set to "YES" in the config file and Blast against Uniprot successfully ran)  
This tool is more time-consuming.

# II - Identify synteny blocks and rearragements (GeneSpace Circos Minimap2)

## Input of step II

### Parameters set in config ==in yellow parameters to be set==

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **option in config** | **description** |
| *scaffolds* | Full path to the list of focal scaffolds (i.e. the scaffolds composing the sex / mating type chromosomes). |
| *==ancestral==* | "chromosome" or "outgroup", whether the sequence used as proxy for the ancestral state is one of the sex / mating type chromosomes or an ougroup provided below. |
| ==\[*ancestral_chromosome_scaffolds*\]== | Compulsory if *ancestral* is set as "chromosome". Full path to the list of scaffolds of the chromosome used as proxy for ancestral state. |
| \[*==outgroup_orthofinder==*\] | Advised if *ancestral* is set as "chromosome". Full path to a list of genomes to be used as outgroups in OrthoFinder only. |
| \[*ancestral_genome*\] | Compulsory if *ancestral* is set as "outgroup". Full path to the genome of the species used as proxy for the ancestral state. |
| \[*ancestral_gff*\] | Compulsory if *ancestral* is set as "outgroup". Full path to the gff (genome annotation) of the species used as proxy for the ancestral state. |
| ==\[*ancestral_outgroup_scaffolds*\]== | Compulsory if *ancestral* is set as "outgroup". Full path to the list of focal scaffolds for the outgroup used as proxy for ancestral state. |

==Give examples of files for scaffolds, ancestral_chromosome_scaffolds, outgroup_orthofinder and ancestral_outgroup_scaffolds ?==

## Operations of step II

### 4a. Minimizer alignment and plots of target region

Corresponding script: `00_scripts/11_run_genesSpace_paml_ideogram.sh`

- Alignment between the two haplotypes using **minimap2**

If you provided as input two haplotypes containing each one of the sex/mating type chromosomes, the whole haplotypes will be aligned.  
If you provided one genome containing both sex/mating type chromosomes, only the corresponding focal scaffolds (as indicated with option *scaffold*) will be aligned.

- Alignment between the two haplotypes and an outgroup genome used as proxy for ancestral state if you have one (option B), using **minimap2**
    
- Construction of whole genome dotplot using **pafR** (only with two haplotypes as input)
    
- Construction of synteny plot on the focal scaffolds using **pafR**
    
ex: minimap based divergence along the mating type chromosomes :

### 4b. Ortholog reconstruction

- Launching of **GeneSpace**

In short, this will:  
\- Identify single copy orthologs with **OrthoFinder**  
\- Construct a dotplot and a riparian plot of whole genome (only with two haplotypes as input) \[==GeneSapce==\]  
\- Construct a riparian plot on focal scaffolds \[==GeneSpace==\]  
For more information, consult the [GeneSpace readme](https://github.com/jtlovell/GENESPACE).

ex: Synteny plot from GeneSpace

![Fig4.png](https://github.com/QuentinRougemont/genome_annotation/blob/main/.pictures/Fig4.png)


#III - Plot dS along the genome
## STEP III - Compute and plot dS - Plot ideogram and rearrangements

## Input of step III

### Parameters set in config

Same as step II (see above).

## Operations of step III

### 5\. Single copy orthologs alignment

Align all coding sequences from the focal scaffolds.

- **TranslatorX**
- **muscle**

### 6\. dS calculation and plotting

- Calculation of dS (& dN) using **PAML**
    
- Plotting dS values using a custom R script
    

Corresponding script: `00_scripts/Rscripts/03_plot_paml.R`  

dS values are plotted along the focal scaffolds, and, if 2 haplotypes were given as input, along the whole genome.  
The gene order will be that of the genome used as proxy for the ancestral state: either one of the two sex/mating type chromosomes, or an outgroup (see option *ancestral*).  
It is possible to modify the R script to adapt the plotting options to your needs (for instance position and direction of scaffolds).

Ex: Ds plot : 

![Fig5.png](https://github.com/QuentinRougemont/genome_annotation/blob/main/.pictures/Fig5.png)


### === - Plot circos (==step III==)

Corresponding script: `00_scripts/Rscripts/05_plot_circos.R [options]`  

Construction of a circos plot of the focal scaffolds, tracing links between their single copy ortholog genes, using **circlize**.  
* If TE info are available these can also be provided as arguments.

* gene density can be extracted from the bed file in genespace and be plotted if provided as arguments

It is possible to modify the R script to adapt the plotting options to your needs (for instance position and direction of scaffolds).

By default any fused autosome will be plotted but these can be removed from the contig list

See **figure4 panel B** above for example.

# IV - Perform changepoint analysis to identify evolutionary strata

## Step IV

### 1\. Changepoint analyses

Before launching this step, we strongly suggest that you consult the results of the workflow, especially the dS plot. i

Once you have deciphered clear hypotheses as to whether there are strata on your focal scaffolds, and where they occur, you can use the R script.

`00_scripts/Rscripts/06.MCP_model_comp.R` to perform changepoint analyses on the dS, using **mcp**.

To that end, you can automatically launch the code ```master.sh -o7``` and it will launch the MCP, producing several graph as well as colored ideogram according for each model infered by the MCP 

![Fig6.A.png](https://github.com/QuentinRougemont/genome_annotation/blob/main/.pictures/Fig6.A.png)

**Figure 6A:** Results from the changepoint analysis for 3  (panel A) to 8 changepoints (panel F) that will be automatically performed to infer evolutionary strata. Each changepoint panel displays the distribution of raw data (i.e., dS values as black dots) along with 25 draws from the joint posterior distribution (grey lines) and 95% highest density interval (red lines). Posterior distributions of the changepoints are shown in blue with one line for each chain. Note that in general the "strata" with zero dS value on the left most and rigth most side respectively will correspond to the PAR, not true evolutionary strata.  


it is important to check the convergence of the runs for each parameters : 
this will be perform automatically in our code resulting in these plots for each changepoint tested.

![Fig6.B.svg](https://github.com/QuentinRougemont/genome_annotation/blob/main/.pictures/Fig6.B.svg)

**Figure 6B:** posterior fit of the model parameter and mixing of the chains. Here only the values inferred for the 7-changepoint model are shown - the one with highest support.
values for all other models are generated on the flye.


The MCP produced many usefull informations that will be extracted and automatically exported in *.txt* tables:

* `modelX.chpt.txt`:  X = number of changepoint tested (from 1 to 9). 

    These files is the output of the summary function from MCP. 
    
    It contains the following columns:
 
    1. name: name of the parameter (changepont and interval) 
    2. mean: mean value of dS and interval (gene order based) 
    3. lower/upper: lower and upper boundaries, 
    4. Rhat: is the Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic which is often taken to be acceptable if <1.1. 
    5. n.eff:  is the effective sample size computed using effectiveSize. Low effective sample sizes are also obvious as poor mixing in trace plots .

* `modelchoice.txt` : 
    This file contains info from the loo model choice operation 

    It contains the following columns:

    1. elpd_diff 
    2. se_diff 
    3. elpd_loo 
    4. se_elpd_loo 
    5. p_loo 
    6. se_p_loo looic 
    7. se_looic

* `weights.txt` : 

    This file contains the weights of each tested models
    higher weights indicates higher supports.


* `HypothesisXstrata.txt` :  X = number of changepoint tested (from 1 to 9). 

    These file contains results from hypothesis testing (BayesFactor and posterior probabilities aiming at testing difference among strata) 

    Here only difference in dS values among adjacent strata are tested when moving forward from the left to the right of the gene order. 

    The two directionalyty of differences are tested, i.e.: 

    "int_1 > int_2": the intercept is greater in strata 1 than 2. 
    "int_1 < int_2": the intercept is greater in strata 2 than 1. 
    
    This is repeated for all comparison of adjacent interval for 1 to 9 changepoints.


* `classif.sX.$haplo1.$haplo2` :   X = number of changepoint tested (from 1 to 9). 


    A three column file containing the assignment of single copy orthologs to a strata :
    1. column1: genes in $haplo1 

    2. column2: genes in $haplo2 

    3. column3: strata of appartenance 

    These file are use to automatically color links in Ideograms. 

* `df.txt` : a dataframe recaputilating all infos 


## other output : 

vio-boxplot with statistical tests. 

here's an example for the two best model in the studied species: 
 
![Fig7.svg](https://github.com/QuentinRougemont/genome_annotation/blob/main/.pictures/Fig7.svg)

**Figure 7:** example violinboxplot for the two "most likely" models inferred by the loo analysis.
By default plots are constructed for all models (from 1 to 9 changepoints). Default statiscal test from the ggstats plot package are used
assuming parametric tests.
